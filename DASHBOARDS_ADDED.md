# 🎉 REAL-TIME MONITORING DASHBOARDS ADDED!

## ✨ New Features

Your Rust EDR now has **professional real-time monitoring dashboards**!

---

## 🖥️ Two Dashboard Options

### 1. Multi-Terminal Dashboard
```bash
./start_dashboard.sh
```

Spawns **8 separate terminal windows**, each showing:
- 🛡️  Main EDR System (all logs)
- 🚨 Threat Detection (threats only)
- 📁 File Monitor (create/modify/delete)
- ⚙️  Process Monitor (spawn/kill)
- 🌐 Network Monitor (connections)
- 👤 User Monitor (login/sudo)
- ⚡ Response Engine (actions)
- 🔬 Forensics (snapshots)

**Best for:** Multi-monitor setups, visual demos

### 2. Tmux Dashboard ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
```bash
./start_dashboard_tmux.sh
```

Single terminal with **6 panes** showing all monitors at once:
```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│   Main EDR      │  Threat Alerts  │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│  File Monitor   │ Process Monitor │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Network Monitor │ User & Response │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Best for:** Professional monitoring, works over SSH, easy navigation

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Setup (First Time Only)
```bash
./setup.sh
```

This creates all necessary directories and fixes the **"No such file or directory"** error.

### Step 2: Start Dashboard
```bash
# Option A: Tmux (recommended)
./start_dashboard_tmux.sh

# Option B: Multi-terminal
./start_dashboard.sh
```

### Step 3: Run Tests (In Another Terminal)
```bash
./tests/run_malicious_tests.sh
```

### Step 4: Watch Real-Time Detections! 🎬

## 🎮 Tmux Controls

- **Ctrl+B** → **Arrow Keys** - Navigate panes
- **Ctrl+B** → **Z** - Zoom current pane
- **Ctrl+B** → **[** - Scroll mode (Q to exit)
- **Ctrl+B** → **D** - Detach (keep running)
- `tmux attach -t edr-dashboard` - Reattach

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### Fixed: "No such file or directory" Error

**Problem:** Forensic snapshots failed to save

**Solution:** Run `./setup.sh` to create directories:
```
/var/log/rust-edr/archives/
├── threats/      (compressed archives)
├── snapshots/    (forensic snapshots)
└── sessions/     (investigation sessions)
```

---

## 🎯 Perfect For

### Development
✅ **Instant feedback** - See detection logic live  
✅ **Debug easily** - Spot issues immediately  
✅ **Test thoroughly** - Watch all components  

### Demonstrations
✅ **Visual impact** - Professional dashboard  
✅ **Real-time action** - Threats appear instantly  
✅ **Organized view** - All monitors at once  

### Operations
✅ **24/7 monitoring** - Runs in background (tmux)  
✅ **Remote access** - Works over SSH  
✅ **Low overhead** - Text-based, lightweight

## 🎬 Complete Demo Workflow

```bash
# Terminal 1: Setup (first time only)
./setup.sh

# Terminal 1: Start dashboard
./start_dashboard_tmux.sh

# Terminal 2: Run ransomware test
./tests/malicious_samples/ransomware_simulator.sh

# Watch in dashboard:
# - File pane: 50 rapid file modifications
# - Threat pane: RansomwareBehavior | Score: 10.0 | CRITICAL
# - Response pane: Alert + Quarantine actions
# - Main pane: Forensic snapshot captured
# - Forensics pane: Investigation shell created

# Terminal 3: Investigate
cd /var/log/rust-edr/archives/sessions/investigation_*/
bash investigate.sh

# Inside investigation shell:
[edr-investigate] info      # Show threat details
[edr-investigate] snapshot  # Capture system state
[edr-investigate] archive   # Archive session
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before First Run

**Always run setup script:**
```bash
./setup.sh
```

This fixes the "No such file or directory" error by creating:
- `/var/log/rust-edr/archives/{threats,snapshots,sessions}`
- `/var/lib/rust-edr`

### Requirements

**For tmux dashboard:**
```bash
sudo apt install tmux jq
```

**For multi-terminal dashboard:**
```bash
# One of these:
sudo apt install gnome-terminal  # Ubuntu/GNOME
sudo apt install xterm           # Universal
sudo apt install konsole         # KDE
sudo apt install xfce4-terminal  # XFCE
```
